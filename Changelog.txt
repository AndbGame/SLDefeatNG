Experimental 1

- projectile hits: only the first hit is taken into account, then the player receives immunity from this projectile hits from this aggressor for 2 sec (instead full immunity for 2 seconds)
- Dynamic defeat widget works not fully correct - it may lag behind the actual value (and a number of other visual problems with this widget)
- and lot of other not implemented stuff (for now it is only experiment for native onHit processing)

Experimental 2

- State of Actors (ACTIVE, DISACTIVE) - Hit processed only in ACTIVE state. After Knockdown state changed to DISACTIVE. On Papyrus side state will be changed to ACTIVE again after events finished
- Actor Extra Info requested when Combat state of ANY actors changed to kCombat (instead first hit) - as result Hit processing of first Hit from actor can be started early (instantly, if the time between the change of Combat state and onHit < ~200ms)
- In addition to projectileSpamGuard, I also added HitSpamGuard. And configuration in `SexLabDefeat.ini` - `CombatManager.HitSpamGuardMs` (1000 = 1sec) - how often Hit can taken into account from the same source and actor. (500ms by default). Only for projectile and magic hits.
- refactoring/implementation (lot of changes). public repo: https://github.com/AndbGame/SLDefeatNG
- compatibility with dfwDeviousFramework (Vulnerability on Hit) still not implemented (todo)
- direct reading of script variables -  is less work on creating patches, SKSE use actual values of configs in real time... but will it work stably? need tests
- LRG Patch is soft dependency (todo: need tests without LRG...)
- todo: need to sort out the SpinLocks....
